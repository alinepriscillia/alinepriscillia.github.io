      <p> A little bit more about me... I'm originally from Paris but I've lived in France,
      the UK, the USA and the Netherlands. Before doing my PhD at NYU, I did an internship
      in Andrea Martin's lab at the Max Planck Institue for Psycholinguistics at the same 
      time as a Bachelor's in theoretical linguistics. I loved neurolinguistics and the neuroscience
      of language so much that I did my bachelor's thesis there (supervised by Dr Yiya Chen and Dr Sanne
      ten Oever)! While my background is quite theoretical, I'm more interested in seeing how language 
      as a cognitive function connects to other functions like memory or emotion. 
      My current research combines neuroimaging (MEG), Natural Language Processing, social neuroscience
      and psychology to answer a broad range of questions about meaningful representations and 
      how they are instantiated in the brain. My dissertation broadly investigates the effect of context 
      on language representations: from the influence of surrounding words on single-word representations 
      to the role that our individual lived experience plays on our understanding and neural processing of a story.
