    title: "Hi! I'm Aline-Priscillia"
    description_html: >-
      <p>I'm a <strong>5th year PhD Candidate </strong> at <strong>New York University </strong> from France. 
      I am interested in individual differences in language processing and semantic representation, 
      from a social and affective neuroscience lens. My work uses
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the effect of local sentential context as well as idiosyncratic personal
      context on neural responses to language stimuli.</p>
