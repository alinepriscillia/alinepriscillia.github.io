    title: "Hi! I'm Aline-Priscillia"
    description_html: >-
      <p>I'm a <strong>5th year PhD Candidate </strong> at <strong>New York University </strong> from France. 
      I'm interested in individual differences in language processing and semantic representation, 
      from a social and affective neuroscience lens. My work combines
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), Natural Language Processing, eyetracking and surveys to answer questions about 
      how we as individuals use and process meaning.</p>
